IBM Data Science Capstone Project
This repository contains the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program on Coursera. In this project, you will take on the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup company called Space Y, which aims to compete with SpaceX. You will follow the Data Science methodology, including data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting the results to stakeholders.

Overview
The commercial space industry is growing and companies like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin are making space travel more accessible. One of the most successful companies in this field is SpaceX, which has accomplished numerous feats such as sending spacecraft to the International Space Station, providing satellite Internet access through Starlink, and sending manned missions to space. One of the reasons SpaceX can offer its services at a lower cost than its competitors is because they are able to reuse the first stage of their rockets.

In this capstone project, you will assume the role of a data scientist working for Space Y and your job is to determine the price of each launch by collecting data about SpaceX and creating dashboards for your team. Additionally, you will use public information to train a machine learning model and predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage of its rockets.

Week by Week Breakdown
Week 1: Data Collection and Wrangling
Collect data via API and web scraping
Perform data wrangling to prepare the data for analysis
Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
Perform exploratory analysis using SQL and Pandas/Matplotlib
Week 3: Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard
Create interactive visualizations using Folium and Plotly
Week 4: Predictive Analysis (Classification)
Train a machine learning model to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage of its rockets
Week 5: Presenting Data-Driven Insights
Present the results of your analysis and insights to stakeholders through a presentation
Usage
This repository contains the necessary code and materials to replicate the project. You will need a basic understanding of data science and machine learning, as well as a software environment capable of running Jupyter notebooks. The following libraries are required: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sklearn.
